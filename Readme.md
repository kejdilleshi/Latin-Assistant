# Main points to improve 



1. Translation 
2. Sense of Syntax: It recognizes sentence structure (who does what to whom), which is crucial for Latin.
3. Grammar Details: It often confuses case endings (e.g., genitive vs. accusative), verb moods (indicative vs. subjunctive), and participles. It doesn’t fully master conjugation and declension patterns.
4. Complex Constructions: It has difficulty with participial clauses, gerunds, and coordination, areas where Latin diverges most from modern languages.
5. Word-Order Issues: Sometimes it translates too literally, preserving Latin word order instead of adapting to natural target-language flow.

`It seems clear to us that we should at least include grammar-focused datasets for fine-tuning.`
